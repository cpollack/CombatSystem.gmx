Data:
Character and enemy data has to 'live' somewhere. Some potential options are
1-text file
2-XML
3-database
4-remote database
1 is easy for init development, but bad for impl. 2 is more secure but difficult to manage with lots of data. 3 is ideal, but may not be very secure. 4 is the final plan for a 'connected' game.
I will need to do some research to find the best way to store game data and manage connectivity.
